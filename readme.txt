BuyEmAll - v1.10

By Cogwheel

BuyEmAll enhances the shift-click interface at vendors.

---------- FEATURES ----------

* Type in the amount you want to buy.

This is actually part of the default UI. Enough people don't know about it due to the fact that there is no cursor and clicking in the box gives no feedback, that I decided to list it here.

* Buy more than the stack size of the item at once.

For instance, if you want to buy 80 pieces of silk thread, you currently have to shift-click the thread, enter 20, hit ok, shift-click the thread, enter 20, hit ok, shift-click the thread, enter 20, hit ok, shift-click the thread, enter 20, and hit ok.

With BuyEmAll, you shift-click the thread, enter 80, hit OK, and confirm that you want to buy more than a stack. This confirmation appears so you don't accidentally buy 1000 of something when you meant to buy 100.

* Shift-click items that come in preset stacks.

The default UI doesn't allow you to shift-click items like Refreshing Spring Water which come in preset stacks. If you want to buy 50 of them, you have to right-click the item 10 times. BuyEmAll allows you to shift-click the item and enter the amount you want. See below for more information on preset stacks.

* Quickly buy a stack of an item.

The BuyEmAll window has a "Stack" button

* Quickly refill your ammo pouch.

If you are buying ammo and have free spots in your ammo pouch/quiver, the amount that appears when you first shift-click the item will be however many stacks it takes to refill your bag. Just hit enter, and you bag will be filled.

* Know how much you will be spending.

BuyEmAll shows you exactly how much money your purchase will cost you.


---------- NOTES ----------

The amount you can enter is limited by:

* The amount of free space in your bags. Partial stacks are included in this calculation, as are specialty bags (e.g. free slots in herbalism bags will be only be counted towards your free space if you are buying an essence, dust, or shard)

* The amount you can afford.

* The number available from the vendor (for limited stock items).

If you can only buy one item for any of these reasons, shift-click behaves just like a left click, picking up one of the item onto your cursor. If you can't buy any, then shift-click does nothing.

When you are choosing the amount for items that come prestacked, the amount you enter is the total amount you want to buy, not the number of stacks you want to buy. If you use the arrow buttons, this number will increase or decrease to multiples of the preset stack size.

The confirmation window will only show up if you buy more than the maximum stack size in your inventory, not the stack size that you can buy at once.

Example: [Refreshing Spring Water] - Stack Size: 20, Purchase Unit: 5

If you enter 18, it will automatically buy 20 with no confirmation. If you enter 23, a confirmation will pop up asking, "Are you sure you want to buy 25 of this item?"
