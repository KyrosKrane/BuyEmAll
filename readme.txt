BuyEmAll - v1.0

By Cogwheel

When you shift-click an item at a vendor, you will now be able to buy more than the stack size of the item at once (assuming you have enough money and room in your inventory). It pops up a confirmation box for amounts larger than the stack size to be on the safe side.

Please visit Cogwheel's Workshop at http://wowinterface.com/portal.php?&uid=17646 if you have any suggestions or complaints.


TODO:

- Add support for items that come in stacks in the first place.
