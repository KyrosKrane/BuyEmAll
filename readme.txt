BuyEmAll - v1.5

By Cogwheel

When you shift-click an item at a vendor, this addon allows you to buy more than the stack size of the item at once. It pops up a confirmation box for amounts larger than the stack size to be on the safe side.

The amount you can purchase is limited by:

* The amount of free space in your bags. Partial stacks are included in this calculation, but specialty bags are not (e.g. free slots in herbalism bags will be counted towards your free space regardless of what you're purchasing)

* The amount you can afford

* The number available from the vendor (for limited stock items). If only one item is available, shift-click behaves just like a left click, picking up one of the item onto your cursor.

Please visit Cogwheel's Workshop at http://wowinterface.com/portal.php?&uid=17646 if you have any suggestions or complaints.


TODO:

- Add information and options to the Stack Split window including maximum amount, buy max button, etc.
- Way down the road... maybe... add a database of items and bag types so that special bag slots are only counted for items that will go into those bags
