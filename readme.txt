BuyEmAll - v1.9

By Cogwheel

BuyEmAll allows you to buy more than the default maximum amount when you shift-click an item at a vendor. For instance, if you want to buy 80 pieces of silk thread, you currently have to shift-click the thread, enter 20, hit ok, rinse and repeat three more times. With this addon all you have to do is shift-click the thread, enter 80, hit ok and confirm that you want to buy more than a stack (this confirmation is there so you don't accidentally buy 1000 of something you meant to buy 100 of).

Additionally, you can now shift-click items that come in preset stacks or items that don't stack at all. If you are buying ammo and have free spots in your ammo pouch/quiver, the amount that appears when you first shift-click the item will be however many stacks it takes to refill your bag.

NOTICE - Despite the facts that you cannot click in the box where the number of items is shown and that there is no cursor, it is possible to type in the amount of the item you wish to buy. This is true for the default UI, as I discovered while researching how to write this addon. Anyway, back to the point...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The amount you can enter is limited by:

* The amount of free space in your bags. Partial stacks are included in this calculation, as are specialty bags (e.g. free slots in herbalism bags will be only be counted towards your free space if you are buying an essence, dust, or shard)

* The amount you can afford.

* The number available from the vendor (for limited stock items).

If you can only buy one item for any of these reasons, shift-click behaves just like a left click, picking up one of the item onto your cursor. If you can't buy any, then shift-click does nothing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some notes on buying preset stacks:

When you are chosing the amount for items that come prestacked, the amount you enter is the total amount you want to buy, not the number of stacks you want to buy. If you use the arrow buttons, this number will increase or decrease to multiples of the preset stack size.

The confirmation window will only show up if you buy more than the maximum stack size in your inventory, not the stack size that you can buy at once.

Example: [Refreshing Spring Water] - Stack Size: 20, Purchase Unit: 5

If you enter 18, it will automatically buy 20 with no confirmation. If you enter 23, a confirmation will pop up asking, "Are you sure you want to buy 25 of this item?"
